# today_events_crawler

this is a simple architecture that does a simple action:
- client makes a call on the server 
- the server scrapes wikipedia getting events happened in the current date
- then server sends back to the client the list of events

If you want to save time don't use this software, just go on wikipedia and digit current date in searching bar. :-)
