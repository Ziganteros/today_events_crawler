# today_events_crawler

this is a simple architecture that does a simple action:
- a client make a call on a server 
- the server scrapes wikipedia getting events happened in current date
- then server send back to client the list of events

there is no reason to use this software, just go on wikipedia and digit current date in searching bar.
